# 🔳 **Modal Window**

In this project, I created an interactive modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A modal window is a pop-up that appears on top of the main content to grab the user's attention.

## 📋 Modal Window Implementation

Here's how it works: 

• **Opening the Modal:**  The modal is opened when the user clicks any button with the "Show Modal" label. This makes it easy to trigger the modal from multiple points on the page.

• **Closing the Modal:** The modal can be closed in several ways:

    • Clicking the close button inside the modal.
    • Clicking outside the modal on the overlay (the area around the modal).
    • Pressing the "Escape" key on the keyboard.

• **Smooth User Experience:** The modal is hidden or shown by adding/removing specific CSS classes, ensuring that the transition is smooth and fast.

• **Focus on Accessibility:** The project includes keyboard interaction (using the "Escape" key) to ensure that it is accessible for users who rely on keyboard navigation.
