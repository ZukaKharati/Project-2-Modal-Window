# ðŸ”³ **Modal Window**

In this project, I created an interactive modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A modal window is a pop-up that appears on top of the main content to grab the user's attention.

## ðŸ“‹ Modal Window Implementation

Here's how it works: 

â€¢ **Opening the Modal:**  The modal is opened when the user clicks any button with the "Show Modal" label. This makes it easy to trigger the modal from multiple points on the page.

â€¢ **Closing the Modal:** The modal can be closed in several ways:

    â€¢ Clicking the close button inside the modal.
    â€¢ Clicking outside the modal on the overlay (the area around the modal).
    â€¢ Pressing the "Escape" key on the keyboard.
